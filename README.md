# ansible-raspbian

[![Ansible Role](https://img.shields.io/ansible/role/30388.svg)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/hannseman/raspbian) 
[![Travis (.org)](https://img.shields.io/travis/hannseman/ansible-raspbian.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/hannseman/ansible-raspbian)

This role will setup a secure basic Raspbian environment with sensible defaults.

### It will:

 * Install specified system packages.
 * Configure hostname.
 * Configure locale.
 * Mount tmpfs on write-intensive directories to increase the lifespan of SD-card. 
 * Change the password on default user.
 * Set the default editor.
 * Setup a secure SSH configuration.
 * Configure UFW.
 * Configure /boot/config.txt.
 * Run raspi-config.
 * Configure Postfix to send email through an SMTP relay.
 * Enable unattended-upgrades.
 * Install Fail2ban.
 * Configure Logwatch to send weekly reports.

### It will not:

 * Update system packages.
 * Run `apt-get update`. Please do this in a pre_task. See [Example Playbook](#example-playbook).
 * Install security patches but unattended-upgrades should take care of that. 

## Setup
* Install python requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Install sshpass by running `sudo apt-get install sshpass`.
* Flash SD-card with [Raspbian Stretch Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md).
* Add empty file named `ssh` in boot-partition of the flashed SD-card.
* Optional: To enable wifi place a file called `wpa_supplicant.conf` in the boot-partition of the flashed SD-card with the following content:
```
network={
        ssid="your ssid"
        psk="your password"
}
```
* Run playbook.


## Inventory

[sshpass](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sshpass) is required to make the first Ansible run
with the default password `raspberry`. Password authentication over SSH will then be disabled in
preference of public key authentication with keys specified in `ssh_public_keys`. 
Your inventory should contain the following:

```ini
[all:vars]
ansible_connection=ssh
ansible_user=pi
ansible_ssh_pass=raspberry
```
